James Martin : `` Matt , I do n't usually like use the word normal when it come to forecasting , but this be a normal an outlook a what I can remember . It 's a story of continue to build after drought , but with that predictable warning that without great improvement in world trade condition , the term of trade for farmer be really go to squeeze . ABARE tell u though that perhaps more of the same be not necessarily a bad thing . His morning , for instance , it 's tell u that the grain harvest for 05-06 be the second high on record . We 've also see , of course , good movement of beef into Japan , and we 're even see some rebound in the wool price as well . '' 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` So it seem that there be go to be high production in many area in the time ahead . Is that go to translate to more money in farmer ' pocket ? '' 
James Martin : `` Not necessarily . Overall we 're see export earnings at a record $ 134b , that 's include mineral and energy . Now in the farm sector alone , those export earnings be tip at $ 29.6b in 06-07 , so that 's up 6 per cent on last year . But the warning be commodity price be go to decline across many area , so while we have increase production push up export earnings from wheat , rice , barley , sugar , wine , lamb , live export and dairy , we also have price for many item fall . Overall , ABARE say commodity price in the ag sector will fall by about 1.7 per cent , follow a rise in 05-06 of about 1.4 per cent . So the bottom line I suppose , the net value of farm production , will actually fall to around $ 6b in 06-07 . That 's down 6 per cent . '' 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` What about the economic picture be paint by ABARE 's chief , Brian Fisher ? '' 
James Martin : `` Economic growth should continue at about 4 per cent , which it have be do over the last 12 month or so . There have be talk of that `` super-commodities cycle '' which be help growth in the mineral and energy sector actually cascade into agriculture . The message from Dr Fisher though be that wo n't happen : '' 
`` There have be people talk about the notion that we 've get a super commodity cycle that a whole lot of the action that we 've see in mineral and energy will then cascade into agriculture . I think frankly that 's a bit simplistic . A lot of the story in the case of agriculture be on the supply side . We be a I say before see a good strong demand , but in the case of agriculture , it 's both a demand and supply story '' . 
`` Brian Fisher also say that farm cost , thing like fertiliser and fuel , will actually increase by about one per cent . Now on oil , the benchmark for oil price , that 's West Texas Intermediate Crude , that 'll stay high in the near term , but over the medium term , down from the current 65 dollar a barrel down below $ 40 a barrel by 2010 . On the dollar , a moderate depreciation , around US73c for 06-07 , continue down though by 2010-11 . That 's a long way ahead , but Brian Fisher 's say perhaps around US65c for the Australian dollar . '' 
Alan Oster ( National Australia Bank ) : `` We think the Aussie dollar be probably go to get down to the level that ABARE 's talk about , except that we think it 's go to come down a lot quicker . So we expect something like 68c by this time next year . '' 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` And that 's go to have a big impact on export ? '' 
James Martin : `` It clearly help in some sens , in the sense that it mean you 're more competitive , but if you 're on the import side , the oil price go down in US dollar , but it really do n't go down at all . '' 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` Now I do n't think you 've get very good news about rural commodity price ? '' 
James Martin : `` Again part of this be that we have a fast fall in the currency , be that in our view , when we look at US dollar agricultural price , we 're down around ten per cent . Now part of that be beef , which have come off really high level , and we think sugar eventually will start to slow down as well . So we 're expect price to come back , and the volume broadly to offset that , so you get those different effect come through . 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` So that might be a fast impact than what ABARE 's predicting ? '' 
James Martin : `` Yes . '' 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` You 've also be talk about continue concern about the labour shortage , particularly skilled labour ? '' 
James Martin : `` Yes , when we run our business survey we find it be very difficult , in fact , even in December this year , it 's more difficult accord to business to get suitable labour than any time , include the late 80 . '' 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` So the concern be always , will that show up in wage ? '' 
James Martin : `` At this stage , the good news be nothing 's happen . That 's why the Reserve Bank be still talk about if we 're go to move rate it 's more likely up than down . At the end of the day , our view on rate will be , they wo n't do anything , but the wage one be critical , and if they see any sign of wage pressure start to move up , then they will pull the trigger . '' 
Matt O'Sullivan : `` Will the importation of labour be likely to hold off wage increase ? '' 
James Martin : `` To the extent that you can take some pressure off by increase the level of immigration , that clearly do help . And in the rural sector we know about difficulty of get people in to help with crop , so it help there . But at the end of the day , I think yes , there 's an element of that , but I think also the domestic part of the economy be really start to slow a bit as well , so I think unemployment 's go to go from 5.2 , 5.3 up to about 5.7 , 5.8 , and that will help . So I think the fact be that within the economy a such , you 're probably not go to have to do anything . '' 
Matthew O'Sullivan : `` Around Australia , you 're listen to a special broadcast of National Rural News from the ABARE Outlook Conference in Canberra . 
`` Well , the Federal Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran tell the conference this morning that the NFF and the government be n't in total agreement about imported worker be a solution to the labour shortage , but certainly agree there be a problem . 
`` John Roach join u now , he 's the chief executive of vegetable grower group Ausveg , John be this a critical issue for the horticulture industry ? '' 
John Roach : `` I think not only critical to the horticulture industry , it 's critical to rural Australia , and I 'd probably go so far a to say that rural Australia 's undergoing significant change in it labour content that it will require , particularly in the next five to 10 year . '' 
Matthew O'Sullivan : `` What about these guest worker scheme ? Are they have an impact in your sector ? '' 
John Roach : `` If I look at other country , yes it do . If I look at New Zealand , part of the horticulture industry in New Zealand do use what I call cheap labour . What they 're do there be bring it it in , upskilling it there , and send it back to those country a part of their aid project , for example . We in Australia do n't have that opportunity at the moment , but if I look at the farm unit in itself , a vegetable grower , much of the innovation happen on small to medium farm business . It 's not the big end of town in vegetable production . So that area be where the innovation happen . You 'd require less labour in that , but you 'd need more specialised labour . 
Matthew O'Sullivan : `` Is there a need to protect small farmer in the future ? '' 
John Roach : `` It 's more about go to inform choice . The vegetable industry in particular will segment itself into three area . One be large production , large farm , work on lower cost . The middle section be about innovation , small farm unit be out there on the cutting edge . The last third of the industry produce about five per cent of production . I think provide inform choice for that sector , of what they actually do with their life and their farm and their asset , I think it 's really important for Australia on social content to be able to allow those people to make informed choice about whether they wish to grow , or not grow and depart . '' 
Matthew O'Sullivan : `` We 've also hear a lot over the past few year about the significant of China to the global economy , and Australian agriculture . Reporter Sally Davison have be look at the impact of China on the world economy . Sal , this week be critical in term of China 's future in the global market ? '' 
Sally Davison : `` That 's right , the National People 's Congress be release it five year plan , a blueprint for national policy maker . This will affect everything from urbanisation , migration into major city , to unemployment . But Yiping Hup from Asia CitiGroup say the energy sector will be most affect by these change . The Chinese Government have say it want to increase energy efficiency by 20 per cent in the next 20 year , by focus on environmentally friendly industry . So the international energy sector be eagerly await the release of the Chinese Government 's five-year plan . ''

Live at the Agriculture Australia 2006 conference 
Matt O'Sullivan bring you National Rural News today live from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney . 
MATTHEW O'SULLIVAN : Hello , I 'm Matt O'Sullivan , bring you National Rural News today from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney , the peak gathering for the grain industry . 
As you 'd expect the future of the single desk for wheat export be a hot topic , and confusion seem to be the common theme . 
The future of GM crop be also be debate today and , of course , there 's plenty of speculation about whether we 'll actually get a decent grain harvest this season - a the ongoing dry drag on , many part of Australia desperately need follow up rain . 
But everybody seem to be talk about alternative fuel , with crude oil price hit new high this week . Delegates believe it 's time the Federal Government offer new incentive to make the switch to ethanol and biodiesel . 
DELEGATE : `` I think there be such an abundance of energy in Australia , you know , they 're not very worried about it . They might as well just sit on their arse and not worry about it . '' 
DELEGATE : `` We 're not get any result at all with the biofuel . The Government 's just not interested to mandate it , and this be not actually go to get off the ground until it 's actually mandate , so it 's really up to the Government . '' 
DELEGATE : `` This issue be now on the table , it 's here . And we ca n't afford to be sit in here in three year ' time not really know where we 'll be and not pick up on the advantage that be there right now . '' 
DELEGATE : `` I fully support the biofuel concept in industry . I disagree with the fact that they 'll be get an excise and I want a level playing field in term of acquisition of raw material . '' 
MOS : Certainly , there 's a feeling that the Government need to do more , and the grain industry need to do more as well to get on the front foot and make sure that grain grower have a big slice of this market for grain . There do seem to be a concern that Australia be a long way behind other country in tap into the ethanol and biodiesel market . One of the speaker here today be Terry Reinhart from Advance Trading in the US . Thanks for join u , can you give u an idea of the industry in the US ? 
TERRY REINHART : Today , it 's about a 4.2 billion gallon industry , which compare to five year ago when it be about a 1 billion gallon industry , and projection be that by 2010 it 'll be a 10 billion gallon industry . 
MOS : So do a country like Australia have a long way to go to try and catch up to that ? Can we catch up to that ? 
TR : The good news about ethanol be it 's a 3000-year-old process by which you take corn and distil it into ethanol , so it 's not real rocket science , and if you have the money it 's fairly quick to build . You can build a 100 million gallon plant in 15 to 16 month , so it 's not like it take 20 year to develop this thing . 
MOS : One of the big concern here be from end user of feed grain , that it 'll be much more expensive and it 'll be hard to get access to that grain . How be the corn go into ethanol in the US affect the market there ? 
TR : To date , there have n't be any effect on the end user , because corn be still relatively cheap . Today in the US we 're over supplied with corn , which be one of the motivator to develop ethanol a a demand for corn , but down the road , a we continue to increase their production , we 're go to have to price corn a fuel a oppose to price corn a food and the livestock producer be concern greatly in the US also . 
MOS : That , I think , be go to be a grow theme , be n't it , that you have more and more different type of grain go into produce fuel and into produce food , when that 's a big issue ? 
TR : Yeah , it 's a big issue , and you can kind of sum up the whole thing if you go back to , I think it be 1998 , one barrel of crude would buy 4.7 bushel of corn and today one barrel of crude would buy 30 bushel of corn , so the price relationship strongly favour corn a a fuel a oppose to be a food . 
MOS : In term of the US industry , here in Australia we 've get a lot of different plant set up in small operation . There 's no sort of overall structure . Is that go to tell against Australia in the long run ? 
TR : I do n't know . In the US , there 's not much structure at this point either . The early people in the ethanol industry be the Cargills and the ADMs of the world . They 've be make ethanol for quite some time , but all the new capacity or much of the new capacity be small start-up operation , group of farmer go together invest in ethanol plant and there 's not much organisation today to all the ethanol plant that be out there and time will tell . My guess be some of these plant be build in the right place and some of them be n't , and we 'll just have to see over time which one be build in the right place . 
MOS : I see a story quote Sir Richard Branson say he 's invest in ethanol plant in the US . Are they start to attract that big business investment ? 
TR : Yes . Early on , four or five year ago , capital be a problem and you just work and work and work to try and find enough money to build an ethanol plant . To put it in perspective , to build a 100 million gallon plant - which be the one they 're build now - it take about $ 170 million to build that plant . Whereas five or 10 year ago it be terribly difficult to raise that money , today you 're hear story of people raise that kind of money in 30 and 60 day period . 
MOS : So there 's reason for farmer get involve in this to have some hope that it will take-off ? 
TR : In the US , I 'd say it have take off , it really have . And the limit resource in the US right now be plant capacity . And if we build all the plant that be on the draw board today , the limit resource be soon go to become farmland , enough land to produce enough corn to fee the ethanol plant . 
MOS : Thanks for your time , Terry Reinhart from Advance Trading in the US . 
You 're listen to a special broadcast of National Rural News from the Agriculture Australia conference in Sydney . 
Of course , alternative fuel have n't be the only item on the agenda here - an entire session have be devote to the future of the single desk for wheat export in the aftermath of the oil-for-food Inquiry . 
Reporter Alice Plate sit in on the session - and Alice , what 's the feeling about the future of our wheat export system ? 
ALICE PLACE : Well the feeling have actually change a bit . In the past , many grower , I think , have try to separate the single desk issue , that be , AWB 's right to veto other exporter ' application to sell wheat overseas , from the ongoing oil-for-food inquiry . And yesterday , at the panel , many of the grower group admit that change be now inevitable . 
MOS : They 're unsure though about what sort of system they want for the future , be that right ? 
AP : That 's right . Looking at the single desk marketing system , it 's not simple , by anyone 's analysis of it . Breaking it down , you 've get on one side the trader , other major competitor - CBH , Graincorp , and the like - all try to get into that market , say that they can give grower good return . And AWB , on the other hand , be say that it can maximise return for grower and give them security . But the Grains Council of Australia , which represent state-based grower body , say that the majority of grower do n't want a change from what they 've get . They want AWB to stay there . They want the single desk . On the other hand , the Grain Growers Association , which be east coast grain grower , say grower do want to know more about their option , that they be really start to question the current system . 
MOS : So be they look for more leadership from the grain body ? 
AP : That 's right . We do have a grower stand up yesterday and say , `` Why be n't you put forward option and recommend those to u ? '' And we have see the Grains Council of Australia , they have do independent report , also they 've look at the Victorian Farmers Federation 's option for the single desk , but they 're say they 're unwilling to analyse and make those recommendation until the Cole inquiry wrap up in September . 
MOS : Thanks Alice . Speaking of the inquiry , AWB have tell the Federal Court today it will cut by a third the number of document it 's battle to keep away from the Cole inquiry . Lawyers for the wheat exporter have tell the court that nearly 400 document will be strike from the confidential list , leave 900 still to be contest . And that hearing be continue in Melbourne . 
Here at the conference , reporter Michael Condon have be in one of the GM session . What have be discuss ? 
MICHAEL CONDON : One of the contentious issue surround the grain industry always be genetically modify crop , particularly food crop . Today we 've hear a couple of distinct point of view express . We hear from the the director of scientific affair for Monsanto . He 's actually address the conference a we speak now . Bit of a coup for the conference . 
He 's come from the United States say that he know that farmer already support GM crop . He say they get good yield . They use few chemical . They have high initial seed cost , but those be easily recoup . He 's say thatHe 's say that farmer be in favour . He do concede , though , that there be a bit of a way to go to convince consumer about eat the food that 's make from g-m crop . Monsanto , of course , famously put their GM wheat on hold for the time be . He say there be no plan to change that . 
But Mr Glick say he 's get a strong feeling that consumer will soon be convince . They 'll come to the party , he say . They 'll realise that g-m crop can do all sort of thing . They can put in special oil to reduce heart disease . They can have certain complex carbohydrate to combat diabetes , and g-m food also have less exposure to chemical in the grow process . So he say he think they will be convince . 
MOS : What about the food company ? What do they think about that ? 
MC : At this stage , George Weston Foods general manager be here as well . He be ask that question . He say at this stage consumer be n't ready . They 'd prefer to see the segregation process remain . He be particularly relate to canola . Keep the oilseed separate that be GM . The other , that 's non-GM be use in food . But he say too that he think that eventually consumer would change their attitude , and it be up to industry and up to research to try and find way of promote health benefit in GM to consumer as well . 
MOS : Thanks Michael , reporter Michael Condon here .

NASA see evidence suggest liquid water on Mars 
Images take by NASA 's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft suggest the presence of liquid water on the Martian surface . 
It be a tantalising find for scientist wonder if the Red Planet ever have harbour life . 
The orbit US spacecraft allow scientist to detect change in the wall of two Martian crater that may have be cause by the recent flow of water , a team of researcher say in a paper appear in the journal Science . 
Scientists previously have establish that two form of water - ice at the pole and water vapour - exist on Mars , but liquid water be crucial to nurture life . 
The scientist compare image of the Martian surface take seven year apart and find the existence of 20 newly form crater cause by impact from space debris as well a the evidence suggest liquid water trickle down crater wall . 
`` These observation give the strong evidence to date that water still flow occasionally on the surface of Mars , '' Michael Meyer , lead scientist for NASA 's Mars Exploration Program , say in a statement . 
The paper say water seem to have flow down two gully in the past few year , even though liquid water can not remain long on the planet 's frigid , nearly airless surface because it would rapidly freeze or evaporate . 
This seem to support the notion that liquid water may exist close enough to the planet 's surface in some place that it can seep out from time to time . 
The scientist propose that water could remain in liquid form long enough on the surface to transport debris before freezing . 
The two bright new deposit be each several hundred metre long . 
They cite a possible alternative explanation that these feature be cause by movement of dry dust down a slope . 

Life on Mars ? 
Scientists long have wonder whether life ever exist on Mars . 
Liquid water be an important part of the equation . On Earth , all form of life require water to survive . 
Among the planet in our solar system , only Earth have a more hospitable climate than Mars , and some scientist suspect Mars once shelter primitive , bacteria-like organism . 
Previous mission find evidence the Red Planet at one time boast ample quantity of water , and the question be whether liquid water be still present . 
`` As with many discovery , the possibility that liquid water may be come to the surface of Mars today pose many question , '' the scientist say . 
`` Where be the water come from ? How be it be maintain in liquid form give the present and most likely past environment ? How widespread be the water ? '' 
They also wonder whether the water could be use a a resource for future mission to explore Mars . 
The two site be inside crater in the Terra Sirenum and the Centauri Montes region of southern Mars . 
`` The shape of these deposit be what you would expect to see if the material be carry by flow water , '' Michael Malin , lead author of the paper , say . 
`` They have finger-like branch at the downhill end and easily divert around small obstacle . '' 
The researcher first report the discovery of the gully in 2000 , but this be the first time they have reveal the presence of newly deposit material seemingly carry by liquid water . 
Last month , NASA say the Mars Global Surveyor mission appear to be at an end , say it have lose contact after a decade-long mission in which it map the surface of Mars , track it climate and search for evidence of water .
